# Getting Started: 
Mutual exclusion is that the basic plan of the matter, the eating philosophers produce a generic and abstract state of affairs helpful for explaining problems with this sort.

# Prerequisites: 
This project needs a package that may support .C and enforced kernel to perform your own call. advocate link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh63RhcyPCs

# Deployment: 
Processes that need synchronization to act properly  manage . However, the synchronic processes that act, there ar some issues to be solved  like dead end and synchronization. one in all the classic issues that may make a case for the matter Philosophers drawback.

# About:
 eating Philosophers drawback are often illustrated as follows:

There ar 5 philosophers UN agency would eat. On the table was reserved chopsticks. If very hungry philosophers, then it'll take 2 chopsticks, that is within the right and left hands.

However, generally just one race takes chopsticks. If there ar philosophers UN agency took 2 chopsticks, then there ar philosophers UN agency have to be compelled to wait till the chopsticks ar placed back. within this drawback, there's the likelihood of dead end, a state within which 2 or a lot of processes can't stay execution.

# Installing: 
1.Install VMware (https://www.vmware.com/) 2.Add .iso file and build a brand new user three.On terminal, compile it with gcc -o obj final.c 4.now, " ./obj" 5.You will get the need output

Problems:
 Some issues are often two-faced throughout compilation of systemcall thus discuss with the higher than youtube link.
